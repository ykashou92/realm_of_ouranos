## Spindle Neurons in Biology

__Spindle neurons__ (SNs) or __von Economo neurons__ (VENs) differ from ordinary neurons in a couple of ways:

- __Structure__ : They are structurally different, and are usually much longer that tapers into a single _axon_ (output) and have only a single _dentrite_ (input) as opposed to ordinary neurons which usually have many _dendtrites_.

- __Abundance__ : They are present in specific regions of large mammalian brains and only a few recorded species have them, they represent an adaptation to larger brains, especially for the function of transmitting information faster.

## Proposed Mathematics of an Artificial Spindle Neuron

In machine learning, a neuron, or a classifier unit is modelled by having multiple inputs and a single output - similar to neurons in biology.

Likewise, we are going to attempt to create a neuron, that has a single input and a single output - similar to spindle neurons in biology, however it will also carry it's characteristic fast information transfer with lower information entropy.

__Artificial Neuron__

$$
p(y = 1 | x) = \sigma(w^{T} X)
$$

__Artificial Spindle Neuron__ 

$$
\psi (\sigma(w^{T} X), \ \delta) = 
$$
